# Experience Web API

### description of what you are expected to build.

The goal of this project is to build a web API people (Techquest students) can go and share their unfiltered heartfelt experience and suggestions for the program, without having to log in and being recognized

## Routes

Your API should have these endpoints.

#### No Auth Routes

- `POST /experience` => add a new experience/suggestion; you should be expecting {text : String} from the client
- `GET /experience` => return all sharedExperience with property show = true
- `POST /login` {username, password}
- `POST /register` what you should be expecting from the client{username, password, name}

#### Auth Route

```
   experienceschema {
    text :
